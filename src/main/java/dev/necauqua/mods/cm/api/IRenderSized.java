 * <p>
 * This API allows to arbitrarily get and set entity sizes.
 * <p>
 * Example use as soft dependency
 * (if you bundle this API with your mod then you're doing it WRONG):
 *
 * <pre><code>
 * public static double getSize(Entity entity) {
 *     if (Loader.isModLoaded("chiseled_me")) {
 *         return getSizeImpl(entity);
 *     }
 *     return 1.0;

 *
 * {@literal @}Optional.Method(modid = "chiseled_me")
 * private static double getSizeImpl(Entity entity) {
 *     return ((ISizedEntity) entity).getSizeCM();
 * }
 * </code></pre>
 * <p>
 * Same with other methods defined in this interface.
 * <p>
 * Put this code somewhere where you use it.
